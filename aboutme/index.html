      <h2>Vern Wolfley</h2>
      <p>
        Let me introduce myself to you! I am married to my wonderful wife Kindy,
        and we have 5 awesome children. Most of us currently reside in hot and
        sunny Phoenix, Arizona. I say most of us because I have a daughter who
        is currently attending BYU Provo and another daughter who is currently
        serving a mission in the Santiago Chile North Mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        I already have a degree in Biomedical Engineering from Arizona State
        University, and a Masters degree in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
        also from ASU, but I am taking some classes from BYU-I to improve my
        computer and programming skills. BYU-I has a wonderful collection of
        certificates in these fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently work for the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) as a
        GIS Engineer/Developer. I am also an early morning seminary teacher
        which is super rewarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between work, school, and my church calling I don't have lots of free
        time, but with the time I have I enjoy building things in my garage and
        getting out doors to hunt, fish, and camp.
