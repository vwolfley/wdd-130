                    <p>
                        Our students benefit from the development of habits and virtue as part of the athletic experience. We strive for excellence on
                        and off the field, providing an experience that shapes our athletes to be better people. The best measure of success of a
                        Great Hearts athletic program is found in the character of the athlete it produces. All of our students can find opportunities
                        to be successful while also being challenged at the highest levels of athletic competition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Great Hearts athletes train and practice with vigor similar to their approach in their academic pursuits. Our athletic
                        programs foster a sense of cooperation that builds community and creates the life-long friendships. Our programs also foster
                        team spirit and encourage the celebration of accomplishments and personal growth. Through community and building
                        relationships, athletes are held to the highest standard of integrity and sportsmanship.
