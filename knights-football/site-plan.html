            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this personal website proposal is to create a high school football website that serves as a digital football program,
                providing information on the team's roster, schedule, and explanations of the game's rules. By functioning as a digital football

            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                The intended audience for this website is parents and fans of the high school football team, offering them easy access to relevant
                information about the team and the sport. The goal of this website aims to strengthen the connection between the high school football
                team, its fans, and their families by providing a user-friendly and informative online platform. It will accomplish this by: 1.
                Providing a detailed team roster, including player names, numbers, positions, and grade levels, ensuring that supporters can stay
                informed about the individuals on the team. 2. Present a well-organized schedule, displaying information about upcoming games,
                opponents, game times, and locations, making it convenient for fans to plan their attendance. 3. Feature a dedicated rules page,
                designed to provide valuable insights and explanations about the official calls made during football games. This not only educates
                parents about the intricacies of the sport but also ensures a deeper engagement with the game.
