## Site Proposal

My personal website proposal is for a high school football website. This site would act like a football program that you would get at a game. It will be targeted towards parents, and fans of the team. This site would consist of three different pages.

- Home page – would show the team roster with the player's name, number, position, and grade level
- Schedule page – showing football schedule, opponent, time, location
- Rules page – to help parents understand the official's calls on the field.

## Purpose

The purpose of this personal website proposal is to create a high school football website that serves as a digital football program, providing information on the team's roster, schedule, and explanations of the game's rules. By functioning as a digital football program, the website aims to offer an easily accessible and comprehensive resource for these stakeholders, enhancing the overall experience for parents and fans of the team.

## Audience

The intended audience for this website is parents and fans of the high school football team, offering them easy access to relevant information about the team and the sport. The goal of this website aims to strengthen the connection between the high school football team, its fans, and their families by providing a user-friendly and informative online platform. It will accomplish this by:

1. Providing a detailed team roster, including player names, numbers, positions, and grade levels, ensuring that supporters can stay informed about the individuals on the team.
2. Present a well-organized schedule, displaying information about upcoming games, opponents, game times, and locations, making it convenient for fans to plan their attendance.
3. Feature a dedicated rules page, designed to provide valuable insights and explanations about the official calls made during football games. This not only educates parents about the intricacies of the sport but also ensures a deeper engagement with the game.
