      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <!-- change this -->
      <p>
        Our goal at White Water Rafting is to inspire, educate, and enable all
        levels of adventure seekers to the thrill of white water rafting. We aim
        to provide a comprehensive platform that offers valuable insights,
        expert guidance, and a community for rafting enthusiasts. Whether you're
        a seasoned rafter or a first-timer, we're dedicated to equipping you
        with the knowledge, resources, and excitement needed for an
        unforgettable white water rafting experience.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <!-- change this -->
      <p>
        Our target audience shares an aspiration to live a bold, experience-rich
        life, and a love of nature. This customer demographic is typically
        between 18 and 50 living in a moderate to comfortable financial
        situation. Their interests lie in engaging in physical activities,
        embracing the natural world, and exploring the great outdoors.
      </p>
      <p>
        They want more than just a vacation, they want an unforgettable
        adventure that provides an escape from the routine and challenges them
        in the process. These adventures seek to immerse themselves in the
        thrill of the white water, connect with nature, and develop camaraderie
        with fellow adventures. They desire experiences that leave a lasting
        impact and stories to share with family and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite their eagerness to embark on white water rafting adventure, they
        struggle to find a streamlined, comprehensive, and reliable platform
        that guides them through their perfect journey. They are looking for a
        one-stop resource that provides detailed information about rafting
        locations, equipment, safety measures, and trip planning. They want
        personalized recommendations, and tailored suggestions for rafting trips
        based on skill level, preferences, and location.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our target audience predominantly accesses websites through mobile
        devices and laptops, seeking quick and accessible information while on
        the go. Thus, optimizing our website for mobile compatibility and
        ensuring a seamless user experience across devices is crucial to
        effectively cater to their needs and preferences.
